# Installing Anaconda

Anaconda is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. You can find the installers at [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and the installation instructions [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).

If you already have Python installed on your computer, this won't break anything. Instead, the default Python used by your scripts and programs will be the one that comes with Anaconda.

Choose the Python 3.7 version, you can install Python 2 versions later. Also, choose the 64-bit installer if you have a 64-bit operating system, otherwise go with the 32-bit installer. Go ahead and choose the appropriate version, then install it. Continue on afterwards!

A bunch of applications are installed along with Anaconda:

- **Anaconda Navigator**, a GUI for managing your environments and packages
- **Anaconda Prompt (Windows)**, a terminal where you can use the command line interface to manage your environments and packages
- **Spyder**, an IDE geared toward scientific development


After installation, youâ€™re automatically in the default conda environment with all packages installed. Verify that conda is installed and running on your system by typing:

```console
$ conda --version
conda 4.7.12
```
Conda displays the number of the version that you have installed.
